Preparation
===========

You need first to prepare both backend and webclient projects if you want to test locally what you're doing.

Afterwards, when you can access the project through http://localhost:9000 or any local URL reachable by a normal web
browser, you need to install Selenium's firefox webdriver or chrome webdriver.

For the second one, "brew install chromedriver" works like a charm.

You will need to set your driver accordingly in test/SauceLabsFactory.scala (CHROME or FIREFOX)

Once you have that, to run the tests locally, run in your terminal:

URL="http://localhost:9000"
sbt run
